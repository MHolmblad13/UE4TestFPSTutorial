# UE4TestFPSTutorial
Practice for putting an FPS game on Github and FPS Tutorial to learn basics of UE4


Followed the tutorial on this link to make the game: https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Tutorials/FirstPersonShooter/index.html The tutorial is for version 4.15 but was made in 4.20.1, it was mainly only missing import statements and minor syntax changes. It teaches the basics of blueprints, collisions, animating, and using UE4 with cpp. Very insightful to learn the basics from as a whole.
